<p>When doing internal penetration tests or Active Directory assessments
you will at one time or another obtain password hashes for accounts that
require brute-force attacks or wordlist attacks to gain the plaintext passwords.</p>
<p>When in this situation, publicly leaked password databases can come in handy to get a sense
of the password complexity and common passwords used by a company. Searching for the
domain name of the company will give a glimpse of the password schema for the leaked accounts.
Cit0day breach, rockyou.txt
or &ldquo;Collection1&rdquo; are a couple of the most commonly used leaked databases.
These databases are most often .txt files with the content &ldquo;<a href="mailto:test@example.tld">test@example.tld</a>:Password123&rdquo;.
After obtaining a couple of the breaches the file size may well exceed 1 TB and your first
option will be to put the data on a mechanical hard drive. When you come to the conclusion that searching
through the content on said mechanical hard drive takes 72 hours, you go for step two.</p>
<p>Enter Fusion-io. The great company behind the product ioDrive - which sole purpose is to serve you
extremely low read and write latency and blazingly high I/O. Fusion-io was founded back in 2005 and their drives
were mostly used by enterprises which required high performant server storage. And these drives
came with a price tag,
a high one. Fusion-io was later overtaken by SSD drives and now NVMe as their retail price became lower,
and cheaper to produce.
Fusion-io went on a turbulent trip, where they were sold to SanDisk, which later was acquired by Western Digital
while meantime, partnership with HP, Dell and Supermicro allowed the companies to sell brand their own
version of the high performant drive.
This may be the reason why support sources and documentation for these drives are a bit&hellip; complicated.</p>
<p>However, ioDrives are sold on eBay for instance, at a reasonable price. 200 USD for 1.65 TB and four
weeks later I had mine installed and ready to crunch password databases.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>As a starting note: Always format storage devices before you sell them. Even better, don&rsquo;t sell them - destroy them.</p>
<p>When attempting to mount the drive I observed a file system.

  <img src="/images/01_fdisk.png" alt="01_fdisk">


VMFS or Virtual Machine File System is a very familiar file system to me. This is commonly used to store
virtual machines that run in VMware ESX hypervisors.</p>
<p>After apt installing <code>libguestfs-tools</code> to handle VMFS, mounting the file system is trivial:</p>
<p><code>mount /dev/fioa /mnt</code></p>
<p>And to my initial assumption, the storage device is not formatted.

  <img src="/images/01_ls.png" alt="01_ls">

</p>
<p>Filenames such as &ldquo;Gold Image&rdquo; and &ldquo;XenDesktop&rdquo; immediately tells that this drive has been
used for Citrix XenDesktop Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment, and a source image,
&ldquo;Golden Image&rdquo;, has been used to provision the desktops.</p>
<p>In short, a .vmdk file (also called the descriptor) is a text file that contains configuration
information about a VMâ€™s virtual hard drive. The *-flat.vmdk file is the virtual equivalent of a
physical hard drive. This is where raw data is written.</p>
<p>.vmx is the &ldquo;inventory file&rdquo; describing amount of RAM, number of CPUs, disk controller etc.</p>
<p>To be able to mount VMDK files, affuse is needed. <code>sudo apt install affuse</code></p>
<pre><code>$ affuse /mnt/P03\ [..REDACTED..]\ 64bit_XenDesktop-baseDisk-datastore-988/P03\ [..REDACTED..]\ 64bit_XenDesktop-baseDisk-datastore-988-flat.vmdk /tmp/vmdk
</code></pre><p>
  <img src="/images/01_ls_vmdk.png" alt="01_ls_vmdks.png">

</p>
<p>In order to mount raw files from within VMDK files, these steps are required:</p>
<p>Get the sector size and start sector of the OS partition with <code>fdisk</code>. Multiply these and
use as offset when mounting the raw file.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/01_fdisk_vmdk.png" alt="01_fdisk_vmdk">

</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 -c 'print(1640448 * 512)'
839909376
</code></pre><pre><code>$ mount -o ro,loop,offset=839909376 /tmp/vmdk/P03\ [..REDACTED..]\ 64bit_XenDesktop-baseDisk-datastore-988-flat.vmdk.raw ./fs
</code></pre><p>And file system access is gained.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/01_filesys.png" alt="01_filesys">

</p>
<p>When having access to a file system like this, first route of attack is to dump
the local SAM database. This database includes hashed passwords of all local accounts,
encryption keys, and Domain Cached Credential hashes (DCC2) if any domain user has been logged
in to the machine.</p>
<p>To dump SAM, pypykatz can be used and is easily installed with pip3: <code>pip3 install pypykatz</code>.</p>
<p>Pypykatz needs access to SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM files that are located at <code>C:\windows\system32\config\</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAM</strong> stores the NT hashes for all local accounts, such as the local administrator</li>
<li><strong>SECURITY</strong> stores DCC2 hashes, service account passwords and various security related information</li>
<li><strong>SYSTEM</strong> contains the information required to decrypt SAM and SECURITY</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <img src="/images/01_sam.png" alt="01_sam">

</p>
<p>The local accounts from &ldquo;SAM hive secrets&rdquo; were sent to the Hashcat box for
cracking: <code>hashcat -m 1000 -a0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt</code>. Surprisingly, none of them cracked even with different
combinations of wordlists and rule sets.</p>
<p>However, as seen in the pypykatz output, a DCC2 hash is obtained. This means that a Domain User account has
been logged into the machine. Hashcat, activate! <code>hashcat -m 2100 -a0 dcc2.txt rockyou.txt.txt --username</code> And pop! <code>&lt;DOMAIN&gt;-SVC-GROUPIT</code> account cracked.</p>
<p>This account could be used to try and access external resources for the affected company,
such as Exchange admin center (EAC), Outlook Web Access, Azure resources etc.
No attempts to reuse these credentials have been attempted.</p>
<p>With physical access to a machine, another trick is also available to login into the machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing ESXi or VMware workstation</li>
<li>Importing the Virtual Machine to the inventory</li>
<li>Booting Kali Linux in forensic mode</li>
<li>Renaming <code>C:\windows\system32\sethc.exe</code> to <code>sethc.exe.bak</code></li>
<li>Copying <code>C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe</code> to <code>sethc.exe</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now what happens is that when reaching the login screen of Windows 7, pressing Shift five times
will bring up a shell in the context of <code>NT Authority\SYSTEM</code>.
This is because <code>sethc.exe</code> is called when the sticky keys feature is activated by the Shift key, and
it is called as a SYSTEM service.</p>
<p>Executing <code>net user &lt;user&gt; RodaLacketSnus1</code> and a new password will be set for the supplied user.</p>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>This Fusion-io drive&rsquo;s former owner was one of the top 10 largest financial institutions in the world.
The accounts gained and the knowledge of internal software and system configurations
of the Windows 7 golden images could be used
to mount an offensive attack against the company with a much more targeted
approach, substantially increasing the success rate.</p>
<p>Cloud migrations rapidly increases the amount of retired storage devices for enterprises as on-prem
hosted infrastructure ends their service. A company policy for handling retired
equipment shall be implemented and followed with discipline, or else data leakage such as this
may occur. Don&rsquo;t let this happen to you.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to let a trusted company, whose core business is confidentiality
and storage device destruction, handle the termination.
The retired devices shall be stored in security vessels until their termination.</p>
<p>The data on for instance storage devices will risk
getting in the wrong hands if they are given to employees or resold on the second
hand market.</p>
<p>All of this information was responsibly disclosed to the affected company who
handled the case professionally and executed internal investigations to make sure
that the accounts leaked had no security impact on the current state of their environment.</p>
